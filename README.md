Ideas about future programs

I'd like to develop some educational programs about physics that are accessible, interactive, and primarily visual.
The programs should be as inclusive as possible.
Little to no typing.
Mouse clicks make the changes.
Pretty pictures and cool graphics.
All math, formulas, and greek symbols should be easily available but not presented without request.
